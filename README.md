# chatbot-trained-neural-network
This repo holds code for a chatbot inspired by a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lwddP0KUEg). It guides users through building a chatbot, covering: structure, conversation flow (intents), training data, neural network architecture, training, functionality, and demonstration. Credits go to the video for the project's framework.
